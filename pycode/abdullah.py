# loops:-  The same thing is ging to repeat so on and on.

# 1. for loop -> It is used to repeat the same thing again and again.
# 2 while loop -> It is used to repeat the same thing again and again until the condition is true.

# Write a Python program to print the multiplication table of a given number.



# HomeWork (3/4/2024):-

# 1. Write a Python program to print the multiplication table of a given number.   Done 
# 2. Write a Python program to find the sum of first 10 natural numbers.
# 3. Write a Python program to find the sum of first 50 natural numbers.
# 4. Write a python program to find the count of even and odd numbers from 1 to 100.
# 5. Write a python program to find the factorial of a given number.
