# Python : It is a high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.

# -> It is very easy to learn and use.
# -> It is an open-source language.

# write our first program in python

# print("Welcome to the class of Python programming!!")

# variables : it is used to store data values.

# a = 10
# print(a)

# comments : it is used to explain the code.


# a+b

# operators and operands

# operators = +
# operands = a,b


# Operators:

# 1. Arithmetic operators

# a. Addition : +
# b. Subtraction : -
# c. Multiplication : *
# d. Division : /
# e. Modulus : %
# f. Exponentiation : **
# g. Floor division : //


# a = 10
# b = "Kwaku"
# c = 10.5

# data types : it is used to specify the type of data.

# 1. Integer (int) : it is used to store whole numbers.
# Example : a = 10, b = 20, c = 30,etc.

# # 2. String (str) : it is used to store characters.
# Example : a = "Kwaku", b = "Python", c = "Programming", etc.

# 3. Float (float) : it is used to store decimal numbers.
# Example : a = 10.5, b = 20.5, c = 30.5, etc.

# 4. Boolean (bool) : it is used to store True or False.
# Example : a = True, b = False


# a = True


# a = 10
# b = 20

# print(a+b)


# a = 10
# b = 40

# print(a-b)

# a = 10
# b = 10

# print(a*b)

# a = 30
# b = 3
# print(a/b)

# //

# %

# **

# a = 30
# b = 3

# print(a//b)

# # a = 6
# b = 4

# print(a**b)



# a = 20
# b = 3

# print(a%b)
