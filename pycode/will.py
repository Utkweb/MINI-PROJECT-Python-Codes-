# Python :

# 1. Multipurpose programming 
# 2. easy to learn
# 3. interpreted programming language 
# 4. Expressive Language 

# Vaiables - It stores up a value in a character or a word


# Data Types : - It defines of which type the data is : 

# 1. Integer (int) - it stores up values without decimal. eg - 1,5,8,-5,7,0,etc
# 2. Float (float) - it stores up values with decimals . eg - 1.5,-1.9969,0.57,etc
# 3. String (str) - It stores up values like words or sentences. eg - "will","Utkarsh","Welcome to the first class!!!!"
# 4. Boolean (bool) - it stores up True, False, 1,0

# type() - this function helps you to know of which type the data is 

# a = False
# print(type(a))

# name = "Will"
# print("Hi what's up ?",name)


# My first name is Will
# My last name is Wijekoon

# comments : - it is used to write a note or a message in the code. It is not executed by the compiler or interpreter

# I'm trying to print my first name
 
# print("My first name is Will")


# a = 10 (integer -> int)
# b = 10.5 (float -> float)
# c = "Will" (string -> str)
# d = True (boolean -> bool)

# a = "10.5"

# print(type(a))

# operators: - It is used to perform operations on variables and values

# 1. Arithmetic Operators : - It is used to perform mathematical operations

# a. Addition (+) - it is used to add two values
# b. Subtraction (-) - it is used to subtract two values
# c. Multiplication (*) - it is used to multiply two values
# d. Division (/) - it is used to divide two values
# e. Modulus (%) - it is used to find the remainder of the division
# f. Exponentiation (**) - it is used to raise a number to the power of another number
# g. Floor Division (//) - it is used to divide and return the integer value of the result/


# a = 10
# b = 15

# print("Addition of a & b is : ",a+b)
