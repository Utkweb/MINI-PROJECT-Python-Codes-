# conditional statements

# data types

# 1. Integer (int) - a number that doesn't have decimal in it.
# Example : 5,2-9,6,0,etc

# a = 9

# 2. Float (float) : a number that does have decimals in it 
# example: 14.5,5.5,etc

# 3. String (str): They are used to words or characters and even sentences 

# example

# name = "Danish"
# sentence = "Welcome to Python Programming"

# 4. Booelan(bool) - it stores True and False only
# falg = True


# variables : It in which we are gonna store the values

# a = 8
# b = 9
# print(a+b)

# + = addition
# - = subtraction
# * = multiply
# / = division
# // = floor division
# % = Modulus
# ** = Exponential

# base = 3 and 


# conditional statements 

# 1. if statement - it is used to check one condition at a time

# if condition:
#     statements

# age = 18

# if age > 18:
#     print("You are allowed to drive the car")

# 2. if-else statement - it is used to check two condition at a time

# if condition:
#     statement
# else:
#     statement

# age = 18

# if age > 18:
#     print("You are allowed to drive the car")
# else:
#     print("You are not allowed to drive the car")

# 3. if-elif-else statement - it is used to check multiple condition at a time

# if condition:
#     statements
# elif condition:
#     statements
# else:
#     statements


# age = 18

# if age > 18:
#     print("You are allowed to drive the car")
# elif age == 18:
#     print("You are allowed for learner's license")
# else:
#     print("You are not allowed to drive the car")


# loops

# they are of two types

# 1. for loop

# for variable_name in range(start,end,step):
#     statements

# 1 to 10

# for i in range(1,11,2):
#     print(i)

# 2. while loop

# a = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number : "))

# print(a+b)

# You need to take two numbers as input from user and also need to ask the user wants to do addition or 
# subtraction

# a = int(input("Enter the first number : "))
# b = int(input("Enter the second number : "))

# choice = (input("Enter your choice from + and - : "))

# if choice == '+':
#     print(a+b)
# elif choice == '-':
#     print(a-b)
# else:
#     print("Invalid input")

# 1 50

# 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20

# 1 3 5  7 9 11 13 15 17 19

# 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50

# 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

# 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81 100

# for i in range(1,11,1):
#     print(i**2)

# num = int(input("Enter the number to check even or odd: "))

# if num%2 == 0:
#     print("Even Number")
# else:
#     print("odd number")


# for i in range(51):
#     print(i*i)


# num = int(input("Enter the value : "))
# print(num*10)

# piggy_bank = 0

# for i in range(0,20):
#     number = int(input("Enter the number : "))
#     piggy_bank = piggy_bank + number

# print(piggy_bank/20)


# syntax:

# while condition:
#     statements

# 1 to 10

# 10 to 1

# i = 10
# while i >=1:
#     print(i)
#     i = i-1

# Nested if elif else

# if color == "Blue":
#     if number == 18:
#         print("A")
#     elif number > 18:
#         print("B")
#     else:
#         print("C")

# String - It is used to store words, sentences and characters 

# name = "Python Programming"
# print(len(name))
