# Operators and operands:-

# Operators are special symbols in python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.


# a+b

# operators: +
# operands: a,b

# Arithmetic operators:-

# 1. Addition: +
# 2. Subtraction: -
# 3. Multiplication: *
# 4. Division: /
# 5. Modulus: %
# 6. Exponentiation: **              
# 7. Floor division: //
# 8. Assignment: =

# Comparison operators:-
# 1. Equal to: ==    
# 2. Not equal to: != 
# 3. Greater than: >
# 4. Less than: <
# 5. Greater than or equal to: >=
# 6. Less than or equal to: <=


# in & not in operators:-
# 1. in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is present in the object
# 2. not in: Returns True if a sequence with the specified value is not present in the 
# object.

# Identity operators:-
# 1. is: Returns true if both variables are the same object
# 2. is not: Returns true if both variables are not the same object

# Logical operators:-
# 1. and: Returns True if both statements are true
# 2. or: Returns True if one of the statements is true
# 3. not: Reverse the result, returns False if the result is true
# 4. xor: Returns True if one of the statements is true but not both
# 5. nand: Returns False if both statements are true
# 6. nor: Returns False if both statements are false
# 7. xnor: Returns True if both statements are true or both statements are false
# 8. xand: Returns True if both statements are false or both statements are true
